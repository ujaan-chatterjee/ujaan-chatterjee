🧩 How I structure projects (what to expect in each repo)

1. **README** — problem statement, business context, dataset, quick results.
2. **Data** or link to dataset (not always included due to licensing).
3. **Notebooks** — clean, numbered; `00-data`, `01-eda`, `02-model`, `03-eval`.
4. **requirements.txt** — exact libs to recreate environment.
5. **/reports** — slide/pdf summary and a short “How to present this” one-pager.
6. **LICENSE** — MIT (or user’s choice).
7. **Roadmap** — what to improve next (hyperparam tuning, productionizing, adding CI).

🚀 How to run (local)

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/ujaan-chatterjee/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>

# create venv (python3.10+ recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # mac / linux
.venv\Scripts\activate         # windows

# install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the main notebook
jupyter lab      # then open notebooks in browser
# or run core scripts
python src/train.py --config configs/default.yaml
```
